# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I am a postgraduate (taught) student reading statistics at Imperial College London.
Before joining the College, I studied mathematics and economics and Durham University.

Below are some interesting things about me.
- I have roughly two years of military experience in the Republic of Korea Army. In most days I served in the presidential security service, and in the final couple of months I moved to artillery. (Never killed anyone tho)
- Music is a big part of my life. I started playing the piano since I was 3, and have been in a band at school, in undergrad, and here at Imperial as well. I can play the keyboard, drum, and guitar, but mainly prefer my role as a vocalist and a frontman.
- Last summer I travelled 10 countries in Europe in 2 weeks. Imagine having lunch in London, dinner in Brussels, breakfast in Frankfurt, and dinner in Milan!

Coding is my weak point. Throughout this term, I will put my best effort into improving my Python and R skills!
